&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Filipe, and I am from Brazil. My main web development project that I'm currentry working on is the web app https://bureauandradebarbosa.com.br/. There, I've started learning PHP, MySQL, Laravel and React js. I started programming when I was about 15 years old, by learning how hacking works, with the book "Hacking: the art of exploitation" By Jhon Erickson, then, I've had to learn the C programming language, and a little of C++ and Assembly, just to understand how buffer overflow occurs.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to collaborate to C# related projects, since I am just about to get a .Net Core job, on all going well. Reach me if you need some help with C exercises, C programming is still a thing in the college. <br/><b>ðŸ“« My contacts:</b><br/>
